            In order to resolve this issue, I added an algorithm curator to the explore page where the user can control the accounts

  <div class="h3-insta">Step #1: User Persona</div>
        <div class="p-insta2">
          According to Pew Research Center, the majority of Instagram’s
          users are between the age 18- to 29 (this is 71% of a nationally
          representative survey of 1,502 U.S. adults conducted via telephone from
          Jan. 25-Feb.8, 2021). I created a user persona to be able to better
          understand the average Instagram user:

        <div class="h3-insta">Step #2: User Flow</div>
        <div class="p-insta2">
          I started off by creating a user flow with screenshots of the original
          app and adding my own algorithm creator screens to understand how a user
          would use the app with my new algorithm curator feature and where I
          could place new micro-interactions. I got my inspiration from Spotify’s
          Discover Weekly feature where a user can control what music suggestions
          they would receive on a weekly basis by liking or disliking songs.

          In order to not run into copyright issues with Instagram, I decided to
          change the name to Pixr as I felt that it still conveyed the main
          purpose of the app being centered around photos. For the logo I put 3
          pixels that are red, green, and blue and made the accent colors these to
          reflect the basic rgb color model used in digital images. I chose the
          font saira and poppins because they are neutral, legible, and have a
          rectangular form to them which fits the pixel theme.

          I then brainstormed micro-interactions that I could include within my
          design and sketched out 20 possible ideas. I decided on a trash can for
          the posts that users dislike and a heart for posts that users like. I
          also wanted to include a feature where a user could chose to either
          message or follow the user without going into the accounts profile to
          streamline the process of finding the content that fits a user’s
          interests best. I created 10 iterations of this idea. These were my top
          four options:

        <div class="h3-insta">Step #5: Low Fidelity Wireframes</div>
        <div class="p-insta2">
          I created low fidelity wireframes that I incorporated my final
          micro-interaction choices and placement of my algorithm curator in order
          to organize my content. I ended up deciding on the post turning into a small picture and falling
          into a heart if a user tapped it and the post crumpling up into a ball
          and falling into the trash can if a user tapped the trash. These give
          clear and quick visual cues as to whether a user likes or dislikes the
          content in a satisfying way. For the message and follow option I put
          different sized pixels in place where users could choose to either
          message or follow the user without going into the accounts profile to
          streamline the process of finding the content that fits a user’s
          interests best. I chose the Pixels in order to stay consistent with the
          logo and name of the app.

        <div class="overview">Conclusion:</div>
        <div class="p-insta2">
          Overall, this redesign encompasses the main features of Instagram and
          adds onto them with an algorithm curator and new micro-interactions that
          help the user reach their intended point of interest. The users will stay engaged 
          and gain more from their in-app experience, which will in turn, help the company to gain more profit. 
          It will also aid local businesses, since the type of customers who like their products
          would now be able to find their posts easily through the algorithm curator.
