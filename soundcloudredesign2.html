                <p class="box1"> I was introduced to SoundCloud by a friend who used it as a
                    platform to post music that he produced. I had always found it
                    challenging to find small artists who had the specific style of
                    music which I enjoyed. That made me wonder if SoundCloud was doing
                    a good enough job in helping these small artists to gain enough
                    exposure. This thought led me to actually redesign the mobile
                    application in a way that I believed would be the best for small
                    artists to gain visibility through SoundCloud, which was through
                    the collaboration experience for artists</p>

        Based on my research, I put together key questions to gain a better
        understanding of the issues small artists face when trying to find a
        collaboration partner. I emailed the survey to the small artists I knew
        and got the answers from six of them. I analyzed the responses to get a
        quick understanding of the biggest pain points (blue is yes and red is
        no).

        and yellow is 3 times or more).

      <li>Artists of a similar genre to yourself easy to find?</li>
      <li>You find the collaboration search process difficult?</li>

        Through the data that I gained from the survey, it was evident to me that
      there was room for improvement in SoundCloud design to help small artists
      to gain more exposure through the app and make the collaboration process
      less difficult. After going through all of my results from the survey, I brainstormed 
      some ideas and came up with the final brief to formalize my ideas:

        When signing into the app, the user would get the choice to sign in or
        create a new account. Since I decided to only cater my design to new
        users, the only option would be to create an account. This would then
        lead to either signing up as a listener or a creator since the two
        experiences are very different for my app.

      If the user selects listener, the next step would be to pick a genre of
      music which they like to listen. When the listener selects a genre, the
      box will get outlined in orange. This feature is beneficial for the
      listener because they can be exposed to more of the music that they enjoy
      on their homepage, but it is also beneficial to small artists because it
      narrows the range of music that a user can see, making it more likely for
      the small artist to be discovered.

      the level of skill the artist has and whether or not they are a good fit
      for them. Step 5 is choosing the best match through a star rank system
      which is based on who fits the user’s criteria the most and will then lead
      them to the artist’s page.

      <p class="p__insta2">
        On the home page, I created another feature which is based on
        SoundCloud’s “More of what you like” section where they suggest songs
        based on what the user has liked or played. I based my section on
        artists who collaborated with the artists of songs the user has recently
        played or liked. This helps small artists gain more exposure and
        listeners to find more songs that they could like.

        Artists will also be able to gain exposure through the explore page.
        Before the user starts typing, they will see rising artists from each
        genre of music. After the user enters the artist or song, the search
        engine will show that artist’s collaborators and they will have a star
        rank next to their name. For creators, it reveals how good of a
        collaboration partner they would be and for listeners it reveals how
        well the artist would fit their music taste.
